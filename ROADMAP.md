# Twilio Voice AI Workshop - Roadmap

## Future Enhancements

### ðŸ¤– Multi-LLM Support
**Priority:** Medium | **Status:** Planned

Add support for multiple LLM providers beyond OpenAI, allowing students to choose their preferred AI model for voice conversations.

**Potential Providers:**

**Implementation Considerations:**

- Add LLM provider selection dropdown to admin panel
- Update WebSocket handler template to support different LLM APIs
- Modify database schema to store provider type alongside API keys
- Create provider-specific configuration templates
- Update cleanup tools to handle multiple API key types

**Benefits:**

- Performance testing across different models
- Educational value in comparing LLM capabilities

**Challenges:**
- Each provider has different API formats and capabilities
- Not all providers support real-time streaming
