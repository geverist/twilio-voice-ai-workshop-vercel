# Recent Fixes & Updates - October 27, 2025

## Issues Resolved

### 1. ✅ Webhook URL Input Field Added to Admin Panel
**Issue:** Admin panel Functions tab didn't have an input field for webhook URLs.

**Fix:** `public/admin-panel-dynamic.html:519-530, 874-919, 988-1010, 845-881`
- Added "Webhook URL (Optional)" input field to the Add New Function form
- Updated `addFunction()` to capture and save webhook_url in tool configuration
- Updated `editFunction()` to populate webhook_url when editing existing tools
- Updated `clearFunctionForm()` to clear webhook_url field
- Updated `renderFunctions()` to display webhook URLs for configured tools with visual indicators:
  - Blue badge with webhook URL for tools with webhooks
  - Yellow warning badge for tools in simulated mode (no webhook)
- Added documentation link to WEBHOOK_TOOLS.md

**Location:** AI Functions & Tools tab in admin panel

**How it works:**
1. Students enter an optional HTTPS URL when creating a function
2. If provided, the webhook URL is saved in the function configuration
3. When AI calls the function, the WebSocket handler POSTs to the webhook
4. If no webhook URL, the function runs in simulated mode

### 2. ✅ Reload Call Data Credentials Check (Working as Intended)
**Issue:** User reported error when clicking "Reload Call Data" in admin panel.

**Analysis:** The error message is intentional and correct behavior:
- Error: "Twilio credentials not found. Please connect your Twilio account in the workshop first."
- This occurs because the admin panel requires Twilio credentials from localStorage
- Credentials are only available when accessed from the workshop after Step 1 completion

**Resolution:** No fix needed - this is proper security behavior. The admin panel correctly checks for credentials before attempting to load call analytics.

**User Action Required:**
1. Complete Step 1 (Connect Accounts) in the workshop
2. Access admin panel from within the workshop (not directly via URL)
3. Credentials will be automatically available from localStorage

### 3. ✅ Conversation History Added to Step 9
**Issue:** Conversation history view was missing from Step 9 (Final Deployment) page.

**Fix:** `public/index.html:8235-8264`
- Added prominent "Review Your Conversations" section to Step 9
- Positioned before the Admin Dashboard hero section for easy access
- Includes:
  - Call Analytics card
  - Full Transcripts card
  - Debug & Improve card
  - Large "View All Conversations" button that opens conversation-history.html
  - Pro tip about using conversation history to refine prompts

**Location:** Step 9 (Final Deployment step) in main workshop interface

**Features:**
- Opens conversation-history.html in new tab
- Shows all past AI phone conversations with full transcripts
- Displays statistics (total calls, avg duration, avg turns)
- Click to expand any conversation and see full message-by-message transcript
