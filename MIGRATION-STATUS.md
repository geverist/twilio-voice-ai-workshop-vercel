# Migration Status

## Current Situation

Based on the migration attempt, your database already has:

✅ `students` table (exists)
✅ `sessions` table (exists)
✅ `idx_students_email` index (exists)

However, the migration failed when trying to create `idx_sessions_student` index, suggesting:
- Tables were created by a previous migration
- The sessions table might not have the `student_id` column properly set up

## Files Created

All migration files have been created and pushed to GitHub:

1. ✅ `api/admin-create-unified-schema.js` - Schema creation
2. ✅ `api/admin-migrate-to-unified-schema.js` - Data migration
3. ✅ `api/admin-list-configs-v2.js` - Simplified dashboard endpoint
4. ✅ `api/admin-cleanup-old-tables.js` - Cleanup script
5. ✅ `UNIFIED-SCHEMA-MIGRATION.md` - Complete guide
6. ✅ `run-migration-local.js` - Local migration script

## Next Steps

### Option 1: Wait for Vercel Deployment (Recommended)

Your deployment is in progress. Once complete, you can run via API:

```bash
# Get your ADMIN_PASSWORD from Vercel dashboard:
# https://vercel.com/geverists-projects/twilio-voice-ai-workshop-vercel/settings/environment-variables

# Then run:
curl -X POST https://voice-ai-workshop.vercel.app/api/admin-migrate-to-unified-schema \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"adminPassword": "YOUR_ADMIN_PASSWORD", "dryRun": true}'
```

### Option 2: Check Current Schema

Since tables already exist, you might want to check if the migration already completed:

1. Go to your Vercel PostgreSQL dashboard
2. Run these queries to check data:

```sql
-- Check if data exists
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM students;
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM sessions;

-- Check if old tables still exist
SELECT table_name
FROM information_schema.tables
WHERE table_schema = 'public'
AND table_name IN ('workshop_students', 'student_configs');
```

### Option 3: Test Instructor Dashboard

The simplest way to verify:

1. Open: https://voice-ai-workshop.vercel.app/public/instructor-dashboard.html
2. Click "Admin Login"
3. Click "Load Sessions"
4. If you see all your students and sessions, the migration likely already worked!

## Troubleshooting

If the instructor dashboard shows no data or errors:

1. **Check which endpoint it's calling:**
   - Old endpoint: `/api/admin-list-configs`
   - New endpoint: `/api/admin-list-configs-v2`

2. **Update the dashboard** to use the new endpoint (if needed):
   - Edit `public/instructor-dashboard.html`
   - Find: `/api/admin-list-configs`
   - Replace with: `/api/admin-list-configs-v2`

## Summary

**Status:** Migration files ready, partial schema exists in database

**Action Required:**
1. Wait for Vercel deployment to complete (~5-10 minutes)
2. Test instructor dashboard
3. If dashboard works, migration is complete!
4. If not, run migration via deployed API endpoints

**Deployment URL:** https://voice-ai-workshop.vercel.app
